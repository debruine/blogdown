Making an R package develops generic coding skills and gives you valuable insight to how R works. We’ll cover setting up a package project, creating functions, documenting them with roxygen, creating vignettes, unit testing, package testing, version control with git, and distribution with github.

Sessions ran Wednesdays from 16:05 to 17:00 UK time from October 5 to December 7, 2022 and recordings are linked to each chapter.
