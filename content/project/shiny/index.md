Do you want to take your R coding skills to the next level in a fun atmosphere where we learn by doing? Join the Coding Club!

We'll be starting from the very basics to use the shiny R package to create an interactive web app that can read from a Google Form and display tables and plots describing your data.

When: Every other Wednesday 14:00-15:00, starting 6 October 2021.
 
### FAQ 

#### Do I have enough experience?

Don't worry if you're new to R coding; as long as you can open RStudio and load the shiny package, you'll be able to participate. All levels are welcome, including undergraduate students and staff.

#### Will it be recorded? 

Yes, if you're staff or a student at the University of Glasgow, join the Methods & Metascience Team with the code j2z7m4w in Teams to access recordings on the Coding Club channel.

#### What computing resources do I need?

You need to have access to R and RStudio. We will use these packages to start: shiny, shinydashboard, tidyverse. See [instructions for installing on your own computer](https://psyteachr.github.io/reprores-v2/installingr.html) or use a university computer or [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/).
