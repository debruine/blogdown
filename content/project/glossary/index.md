There is a lot of necessary jargon to learn for coding. The goal of glossary is to provide a lightweight solution for making glossaries in educational materials written in quarto or R Markdown. This package provides functions to link terms in text to their definitions in an external glossary file, as well as create a glossary table of all linked terms at the end of a section.

Hopefully on CRAN soon!
