The goal of WebMorph and the associated R package, webmorphR, is to make the construction of image stimuli more reproducible, with a focus on face stimuli.

<p class="error">
As of September 2023, webmorph.org is down following identification of a security vulnerability. I am working on moving all functions to webmorphR and removing the ability to store images online.

<p class="info">
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/webmorphR/index.html">webmorphR</a> is now on CRAN!

The development of these tools was funded by ERC grant #647910 (KINSHIP).
