summary: Open science practices in the University of Glasgow's School of Psychology and Neuroscience
tags: [open science]

abstract: This session will outline some open science practices in the University of Glasgow's School of Psychology and Neuroscience. For example, our staff and students stay on top of new developments through regular seminars and workshops sponsored by the Methods and MetaScience network. Our undergraduate and postgraduate methods curricula were overhauled to embed open science practices and the skills needed to achieve them. After a brief outline, we will open the floor for discussion around the benefits and challenges of increasing open science practices.
