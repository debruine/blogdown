abstract: Research transparency and integrity benefit greatly from computationally reproducible code, but the barriers to learning the required skills can seem overwhelming. In this talk, I will summarise the benefits of using code to process and analyse data, give some practical tips for developing your skills, demonstrate how data simulation can improve your research, and discuss the benefits of code review.
