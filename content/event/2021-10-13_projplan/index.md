abstract: This seminar will highlight a few things you can do during the planning stage of your project to help you develop healthy research habits, such as thinking about formulating suitable research questions (qual and quant), including positive and negative controls to test whether the collected data make sense, justifying sample size and other design decisions, or simulating data to create a concrete data cleaning and analysis plan. The talk is aimed at undergraduate and MSc students just starting their dissertations, but is applicable to anyone starting a qualitative or quantitative research project.
