summary: How large-scale collaborations such as the Psychological Science Accelerator can improve both replicability and generalisability.

tags: [PSA, team science]

abstract: The "replication crisis" has led to a call for initiatives to increase the replicability of psychological science, such as data and code sharing, pre-registration, registered reports, and reproducible workflows. Similarly, researchers have questioned the extent to which studies of WEIRD populations (Western, Educated, Industrialised, Rich, and Democratic) generalise to the majority of people in the rest of the world. Here, I will discuss how large-scale collaborations can improve both replicability and generalisability, with a focus on the Psychological Science Accelerator, a globally distributed network of more than 1300 researchers from more than 70 countries across all six populated continents.
