abstract: Starting a big team science project requires a number of tools and resources for organising communication and information. Your project is likely to need a website, social media presence, a way for members to sign up, a discussion forum, email lists, file collaboration, and file storage. It will also need a core team to work on the organisational infrastructure and agree on processes for conduct and decision making. In this workshop, we will discuss the needs that a new project has and how to meet those needs with little or no budget and limited volunteer time.
